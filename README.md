# PADM
This is the first group project completed in the UNCC Coding Boot Camp


The purpose of the app was to simplify the decision making process for a user who wants to stream a movie online.

The login/social media interface was never completed and, based on the simple nature of the project, largely unnecessary.

Once on the main page, a user selects from the different criteria to narrow down their search and the page makes an external API call
through the omdb and themoviedb APIs. After filtering through the results they are displayed in the three tabs in the center of the page.

If the user wishes, they may run the search up to 3 times total, after which the selectors are disabled.
There's nothing to stop the user from refreshing the page to run the search again but that would ultimately defeat the purpose of the app.
